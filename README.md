The goal of this exercise is to create a bash-based or python-based measurement of flow completion time and throughput in a network.

## Flow Completion Time
I have to create a short burst of data (which is primarily where FCT is relevant). This can be emulated through certain sized data packets being sent in between hosts.

FCT will now be used regardless of transfer size.

Based on previous research, a query message is considered to be (2kb to 20kb) while a query is around (100kb to 1mb).

## Throughput


# Todo
Process data after testing to save on CPU usage.
